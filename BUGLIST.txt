fixing for 19.6:
- telltale heart mechanics are buggy afaik, need to test and fix

- wortox drops a soul when he dies (fixed, needs testing, might need a better fix later)
- switching to spectator mode during match countdown does not re-assign teams (fixed, needs testing)
- players can stall indefinitely by despawning repeatedly (needs testing, but players can no longer despawn during countdown)

- pigs targetting players is very wonky in so many situations and it really needs to be more consistent
(note from electro: i'll fix this one since i have a good idea of how the current targetting works)
