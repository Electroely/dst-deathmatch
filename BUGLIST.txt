- Telltale hearts start spawning as soon as mode changes
- Ghost entry in bottom of new player list
- Wormwood still shows visual effects while spectating
- Wendy's rework perks were never removed

- pigs targetting players is very wonky in so many situations and it really needs to be more consistent
(note from electro: i'll fix this one since i have a good idea of how the current targetting works)
