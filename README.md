Deathmatch PvP mode for Don't Starve Together

This is a mod that adds a whole new game mode to Don't Starve Together. Unlike the current game modes the game currently has (survival, endless, wilderness), the mode this mod adds a separate world and separate gameplay, with several base game mechanics modified.

The deathmatch mode aims to provide players with a balanced and unique PvP mode. The only focus of the mod is PvP, so it is required that PvP is enabled with servers that use this mod.

Note that a separate mod is required to run this in a server, currently not publicly available. Also, it can only be hosted through a dedicated server.
