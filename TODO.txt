- QoL Tweaks:
	stuff to make playing more enjoyable. preferably features that wouldn't take long to implement
	* spectator ghosts have the same spectator spinner as dead players
	* spectator spinner shouldn't target spectator ghosts (except self)
	
- Figure out a better transition between cosmetic states for wolfgang and wurt

- Anti-camping mechanics
	How about this: everytime a player dies, everyone gets a damage boost based on how much dmg they dealt in the match
	as for the mechanics...
	- there'd be a global tunable damage multiplier for such damage boost (maybe put at x2 for now)
	- every time a player dies, every other player will get a damage boost following the following formula:
		(% of players remaining)*(damage dealt by player / total damage dealt in match)*base mult
	- that way players will be encouraged to fight more, and it wouldnt be an rng roll like items
	
- Methods of stopping a "snowballing" Team in the team modes
	* Add Telltale hearts in some way, can't drop the old fashioned way in the middle since winning teams would just hog those
	update:
	change reviving speed to be fast, but slows down the more people are revived in a match.
	telltale hearts skip revival animation entirely, but the speed penalty becomes a revival health penalty
	
- Pig King should sleep when the full moon happens in the Pig Village map
- Pig King should throw powerups randomly around him rather than in a specific direction (ik its random but still)
- Powerups shouldn't land very far from Pig King (min dist to avoid bouncing off him, max dist to limit to wood turf?)

- New Pickup Buffs
	buffs that last forever but only have a limited effect, usually stackable
	* buff that reduces damage taken from next hit by 75%
	* buff that makes the next special not trigger a cooldown
	* maybe more buffs along these lines
	update:
	maybe an alternative pickup for each one of existing ones?
	they'd all be in the style mentioned above BUT they only spawn when there's no contest for mid?
	

- Team Chat
	* press T to open chat for team
	* like whispers, but would show [T] instead of [W]
	* chat would only visible for members of the player's team
	
- Team Preference
	* chat command to pick a preferred team in rvb
	* chat command to pick a player to be paired with in 
	update:
	* use /setteam to pick a preferred team color in both modes
	* ability to request paring through player info screen (the one that shows up when you examine someone)

- Deathmatch Menu:
	Create a new screen that leads the player to:
	* main deathmatch menu:
		- shows statistics such as kills, deaths, damage dealt (in most recent match), etc(?)
		- allows player to view statistics for other players (?)
		- buttons to start match, cancel start (if initiated by player), vote to stop, change chars, etc
	* maps submenu:
		- describes what each map is (maybe with screenshots?)
		- allows the player to start a map vote (vote with all maps in the game)
		- allows the player to start a vote for a specific map (with yes/no options)
	* teams submenu:
		- describes the different team modes (ffa, rvb, 2pt, custom)
		- allows the player to pick a preferred team for red v blue
		- allows the player to pick a teammate for 2-player teams
		- allows the player to pick a team for custom
	* gear submenu:
		- shows all gear players can use, categorized by slots:
			melee 1
			melee 2
			melee 3
			melee 4
			consumable (like fire crystals)
			armor
			hat
		- shows a description of each item (written desc, stats, screenshots?)
		- allows players to change which gear they use for each slot (except consumable)
		  note: check "Alternate Gear" for more info
	* maybe more later idk, more specific details / concept art images would help
	the main goal is to make deathmatch-specific functions easier to access (people tend to forget the commands
	exist or just not know about them. did you know the mod has an afk function?) as well as giving players more info
	about stuff without making someone else explain it for them

	
- Alternate Gear:
	basic idea: each weapon in the game has its own role, and deathmatch isn't complete without all 4 of them
	so the idea is that we could make new weapons to work as alternatives for an existing weapon
	the alternatives would have similarities to the original, such as usage animation or range or w/e and would
	serve the same purpose but would be functionally different and hopefully unique enough for people to want
	to pick a favorite that isn't defined by some meta that develops behind my back
	
	maybe something like a fossil-theme hammer that spawns a bone cage before jumping, or a ice-theme sword
	that protects the player using ice. i don't have any good specific ideas in mind currently but i think there's
	already a lot of work to do before we get to this point
	
-More Maps:
	-Lunar island/ lunar based map
	-Boat map? Maybe with some of those Whirlpools I created a while back
	-A map with the Forest stalker, his light bulbs are powerups
	-Map with malbatross, get its feathers to get stuff?
	-A Maze arena with a somewhat powerful weapon in the middle, the weapon can be knocked out of players inventories?
		-yooo, Maybe a maze with antlion and his sand spikes, and the maze shifts and changes every minute or two?
			-The way this could work is, we have some different object layers in tiled with different mazes constructed on each layer with the sandblocks,
			each maze's sandblocks has a tag like "maze1" In the game, we make all sandblocks with maze1 appear first, and then make all sandblocks with maze2
			appear and so on, It'd be better if it was truly random but I dunno how to do that ecksdee
	-MUSHROOM DRUG LAND
		-eat SHROOMS to get larger or smaller like mario
	
-A sign in the lobby that lists change log and new updates, maaaybe?
