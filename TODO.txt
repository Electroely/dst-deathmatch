- FINISH THE BUTTON CONTROLS
	- Add hover text
	- Update tips screen
		- The entries in the list need to generally take up less vertical space
		- The text for the tips themselves doesn't properly fill the screen
		- There might be a need for images within the tips screen
		- tip icons?
	- Make the change team button work
		- Clicking the button opens a wheel showing every selectable team?
			- Other players are shown instead of teams in 2-player teams
			- Button can also be used to accept/reject "team up with" requests
			- Clicking the original "change team" button clears team preference	(separate option in the wheel might be better?)
	- Add weapon choice button?
		- Instead of players scrambling to equip their favorites every match, they can set them with a menu button
		- We can get a lot of mileage out of the option wheel idea

- INVENTORY REWORK
	- The vanilla inventory doesn't really fit very well
	- Instead of 15 slots with 3 equip slots, there would be 4 slots for weapons and 5 slots for extras (like hearts and firebombs)
	- Technical side: We still keep a large inventory, we just have slots dedicated to the equippable weapons
	- For useable hats & armors, we create new dummy hand-equippable items that make the player look as if they aren't holding anything
	  Said items would carry out the actual weapon effect (interacting with the hat/armor anim entities accordingly)

- PHASE OUT THE SERVER COMMANDS MENU
	- It's unintuitive - it might be better to make it an on screen button. Maybe in the top right?

- UPDATE INFO WIDGET
	- A bunch of text ain't doin' it
	- We still need a good indicator on which players are alive 

- UPDATE PLAYER LIST
	- It's outdated, jank and all-around difficult to work with
	- It displays information that could be displayed elsewhere
	- Maybe it can be replaced with a set (grid?) of health badges
	- Use skin silhouettes to make figuring out which player is which easier
	- Color the red part of the badge with team color for team battles?
		- High risk of ugly UI, scrapping is an option



================================================== OLD TODO'S =======================================================

- Telltale heart rework: make them a complexprojectile you throw at your teammates to revive them. Same hp revival mechanics as current, but the heart spawns get rarer as more people are revived.

- Lunar Grotto Map
        - Map with lots of lunar mushtrees, and light flowers
        - One use bug nets occasionally spawn in the middle
        - Lightflower bulbs visually are replaced with a powerup looking bulb
        - Lightflower bulbs when picked will spawn a light bug which has its bulb replaced with a powerup
        - Light bugs can be caught and murdered to gain their powerup or kept to have other lightbugs circle around the player and give a small buff to the player
        - Circling light bugs will only provide half or a third of the original powerup
        - Players are encouraged to mix and match their light bug circles (e.g. have 2 speed light bugs and one damage light bug)
        - Players are also encouraged to kill other players light bugs to get rid of their buffs
        - P.S. (Maybe specials dont damage light bugs? I mean one or two hammer specials and bam light bugs are gone in an instant)


- Swell Shoal map
	- circular map with pool of ocean water in the middle
	- Malbatross circles this pool and dashes through its center
	- Drops its feathers (attacked? after dashing? figure it out!)
	- Feathers can be picked up and horded for small, stacking stat boosts. Taking damage removes a feather from the target's inv

- Deathmatch Info Popups
	- remember how I said popups were too intrusive? what if did added again
	- ...but made them less intrusive this time? they could be little textboxes in a corner with lots of text
	  and an x button in the corner, kind of like the ones in ONI
	- re-using the current popup push code would work, since the actual push widget code is like 1-2 lines

- Update Deathmatch Status widget
	the current one in the top right could use some extra info, such as...
	* display number of live players in each team in a format maybe similar to:
		Live players:
	Electroely	|	Hornet
	Whimsicott	|	Player4
	etc
	or for team battles:
		Live players:
	1 Red 		|	1 Blue
	1 Yellow	|	1 Green
	etc
	* display preferred team choice whenever that's implemented (hopefully soon?)

- Anti-camping mechanics
	How about this: everytime a player dies, everyone gets a damage boost based on how much dmg they dealt in the match
	as for the mechanics...
	- there'd be a global tunable damage multiplier for such damage boost (maybe put at x2 for now)
	- every time a player dies, every other player will get a damage boost following the following formula:
		(% of players remaining)*(damage dealt by player / total damage dealt in match)*base mult
	- that way players will be encouraged to fight more, and it wouldnt be an rng roll like items
	
- Figure out a better transition between cosmetic states for wolfgang and wurt
	  
- New Pickup Buffs
	buffs that last forever but only have a limited effect, usually stackable
	* buff that reduces damage taken from next hit by 75%
	* buff that makes the next special not trigger a cooldown
	* maybe more buffs along these lines
	update:
	maybe an alternative pickup for each one of existing ones?
	they'd all be in the style mentioned above BUT they only spawn when there's no contest for mid?
	
- Deathmatch Menu:
	Create a new screen that leads the player to:
	* main deathmatch menu:
		- shows statistics such as kills, deaths, damage dealt (in most recent match), etc(?)
		- allows player to view statistics for other players (?)
		- buttons to start match, cancel start (if initiated by player), vote to stop, change chars, etc
	* maps submenu:
		- describes what each map is (maybe with screenshots?)
		- allows the player to start a map vote (vote with all maps in the game)
		- allows the player to start a vote for a specific map (with yes/no options)
	* teams submenu:
		- describes the different team modes (ffa, rvb, 2pt, custom)
		- allows the player to pick a preferred team for red v blue
		- allows the player to pick a teammate for 2-player teams
		- allows the player to pick a team for custom
	* gear submenu:
		- shows all gear players can use, categorized by slots:
			melee 1
			melee 2
			melee 3
			melee 4
			consumable (like fire crystals)
			armor
			hat
		- shows a description of each item (written desc, stats, screenshots?)
		- allows players to change which gear they use for each slot (except consumable)
		  note: check "Alternate Gear" for more info
	* maybe more later idk, more specific details / concept art images would help
	the main goal is to make deathmatch-specific functions easier to access (people tend to forget the commands
	exist or just not know about them. did you know the mod has an afk function?) as well as giving players more info
	about stuff without making someone else explain it for them

	
- Alternate Gear:
	basic idea: each weapon in the game has its own role, and deathmatch isn't complete without all 4 of them
	so the idea is that we could make new weapons to work as alternatives for an existing weapon
	the alternatives would have similarities to the original, such as usage animation or range or w/e and would
	serve the same purpose but would be functionally different and hopefully unique enough for people to want
	to pick a favorite that isn't defined by some meta that develops behind my back
	
	maybe something like a fossil-theme hammer that spawns a bone cage before jumping, or a ice-theme sword
	that protects the player using ice. i don't have any good specific ideas in mind currently but i think there's
	already a lot of work to do before we get to this point
	
- Capture the flag mode
	The key mechanics in the Atrium map make people fight over the key a lot, so why not make a mode where fighting over the key is the main goal?
	Not sure if the world can fit new maps as-is, so we can't really do a CTF map for each map (unless we make a 2nd world for ctf style modes?)
	doesn't have to be just regular ctf. maybe there could be something like mk8 shine theif for ffa, and maybe something else for 2pt
	
-More Maps:
	-Lunar island/ lunar based map
	-Boat map? Maybe with some of those Whirlpools I created a while back
	-A map with the Forest stalker, his light bulbs are powerups
	-Map with malbatross, get its feathers to get stuff?
	-A Maze arena with a somewhat powerful weapon in the middle, the weapon can be knocked out of players inventories?
		-yooo, Maybe a maze with antlion and his sand spikes, and the maze shifts and changes every minute or two?
			-The way this could work is, we have some different object layers in tiled with different mazes constructed on each layer with the sandblocks,
			each maze's sandblocks has a tag like "maze1" In the game, we make all sandblocks with maze1 appear first, and then make all sandblocks with maze2
			appear and so on, It'd be better if it was truly random but I dunno how to do that ecksdee
	-MUSHROOM DRUG LAND
		-eat SHROOMS to get larger or smaller like mario
	
-A sign in the lobby that lists change log and new updates, maaaybe?
