- QoL Tweaks:
	stuff to make playing more enjoyable. preferably features that wouldn't take long to implement
	* popups instead of system messages
		- can be client-sided
		- require manual user confirmation rather than fading away
		- can list more info at once
	* timer in character select
		- makes it more apparent to people who despawn that they might miss a match
	* players shouldn't be able to despawn after timer starts
	* spectator ghosts have the same spectator spinner as dead players
	* spectator spinner shouldn't target spectator ghosts (except self)
	
- New Pickup Buffs
	buffs that last forever but only have a limited effect, usually stackable
	* buff that reduces damage taken from next hit by 75%
	* buff that makes the next special not trigger a cooldown
	* maybe more buffs along these lines


- Team Chat
	* press T to open chat for team
	* like whispers, but would show [T] instead of [W]
	* chat would only visible for members of the player's team
	
- Team Preference
	* chat command to pick a preferred team in rvb
	* chat command to pick a player to be paired with in 2pt
	

- Deathmatch Menu:
	Create a new screen that leads the player to:
	* main deathmatch menu:
		- shows statistics such as kills, deaths, damage dealt (in most recent match), etc(?)
		- allows player to view statistics for other players (?)
		- buttons to start match, cancel start (if initiated by player), vote to stop, change chars, etc
	* maps submenu:
		- describes what each map is (maybe with screenshots?)
		- allows the player to start a map vote (vote with all maps in the game)
		- allows the player to start a vote for a specific map (with yes/no options)
	* teams submenu:
		- describes the different team modes (ffa, rvb, 2pt, custom)
		- allows the player to pick a preferred team for red v blue
		- allows the player to pick a teammate for 2-player teams
		- allows the player to pick a team for custom
	* gear submenu:
		- shows all gear players can use, categorized by slots:
			melee 1
			melee 2
			melee 3
			melee 4
			consumable (like fire crystals)
			armor
			hat
		- shows a description of each item (written desc, stats, screenshots?)
		- allows players to change which gear they use for each slot (except consumable)
		  note: check "Alternate Gear" for more info
	* maybe more later idk, more specific details / concept art images would help
	the main goal is to make deathmatch-specific functions easier to access (people tend to forget the commands
	exist or just not know about them. did you know the mod has an afk function?) as well as giving players more info
	about stuff without making someone else explain it for them

	
- Alternate Gear:
	basic idea: each weapon in the game has its own role, and deathmatch isn't complete without all 4 of them
	so the idea is that we could make new weapons to work as alternatives for an existing weapon
	the alternatives would have similarities to the original, such as usage animation or range or w/e and would
	serve the same purpose but would be functionally different and hopefully unique enough for people to want
	to pick a favorite that isn't defined by some meta that develops behind my back
	
	maybe something like a fossil-theme hammer that spawns a bone cage before jumping, or a ice-theme sword
	that protects the player using ice. i don't have any good specific ideas in mind currently but i think there's
	already a lot of work to do before we get to this point
	
-More Maps:
	-Lunar island/ lunar based map
	-Boat map? Maybe with some of those Whirlpools I created a while back
	-A map with the Forest stalker, his light bulbs are powerups
	-A Maze arena with a somewhat powerful weapon in the middle, the weapon can be knocked out of players inventories?
		-yooo, Maybe a maze with antlion and his sand spikes, and the maze shifts and changes every minute or two?
